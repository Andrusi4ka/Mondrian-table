# Mondrian table

**[Result](https://andrusi4ka.github.io/Fullstack-home-work-6/)**

The task is to create a table inspired by the style of Piet Mondrianâ€™s paintings. Our goal is to reproduce a layout that visually resembles his works. It is not necessary to achieve perfect pixel accuracy with the originals, but it is important to follow the main principles of his design.

### Special requirements for the assignment:

**- Structural minimalism:**

In the created table, only the necessary number of columns and rows are used. Superfluous elements are completely absent, and the structure of the table is as simple and efficient as possible.

**- Prohibition of hidden columns and rows:**

No hidden columns or rows were used in the table. All elements of the table are displayed openly and transparently.

**- Merging cells:**

Cells were merged wherever possible to create larger spatial segments. This ensured adherence to the Mondrian style and allowed for a clean and harmonious composition.

**- Attention to detail:**

Special attention was given to the visual elements of the layout. The size, proportions, and placement of the segments were considered to achieve the most accurate reproduction of the artistic style.
